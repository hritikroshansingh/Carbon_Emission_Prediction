# Carbon_Emission_Prediction

This project is focused on preparing and cleaning climate change data obtained from a global dataset. The objective is to transform raw data into a clean format that can be used for further analysis and modeling.

## ðŸ“Œ Description

- **`climate_change_download_0.xls`**: This is the original dataset containing raw climate change data sourced from a reliable international database (e.g., World Bank).
- **`1_data_preparation.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook that:
  - Loads the Excel file
  - Cleans the data by handling missing values, renaming columns, and formatting
  - Outputs a cleaned version as `data_cleaned.csv`
- **`data_cleaned.csv`**: Final cleaned dataset that can be used for visualization, analysis, or machine learning tasks.
